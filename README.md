# ResearchPaperSearchCatalogue
"Data deluge" and "Information overload" are just a few of the catch phrases that describe the

incredible and mostly unmanageable amounts of information available on the internet. Although

a lot of information is easily available on the internet, it can be a time consuming and frustrating

task to sieve through all this data and find some relevant information. Similar situation arises

during the search for pertinent research papers through the multitude of data available over

various resources. The objective of this project is to implement an application to query and

optimally retrieve relevant research papers and publications to facilitate research objectives. We

plan to implement and demonstrate a working prototype for this as an enhancement to the GT

Library Catalogue. The application can be used to search for research papers or journals over a

simple intuitive UI.

Multiple search criteria will available for the user to do a customized search, for instance title,

author and content of the publication. The application will also allow authorized users to upload

new research papers into the database system. This authorization is essential to ensure data

quality and integrity. The unique feature of the project is that, the user will also be recommended

a list of related research papers, based on the analysis of the initial query. We also intend to show

links to relevant papers referenced in the paper or written by the same/similar set of authors. The

recommendations will not only help the users find more research papers in their area of interest,

but also will facilitate faster and more effective understanding of the material involved. This

leads to an effective and efficient search and the time wasted on finding relevant papers on a

vanilla search engine, not designed for document search, can then be put to better use.
